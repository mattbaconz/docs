## Settings Explained

### Rates
- `tier1`: The percentage (0.05 = 5%) allocated to the direct recruiter.
- `tier2`: The percentage allocated to the second-level recruiter.
- `referral-bonus`: A fixed amount paid to the recruiter immediately upon a successful join.

### Operation Mode
- **tax**: The commission is taken from the invitee's earnings. This mimics a traditional tax or fee structure.
- **printer**: The commission is added on top of the invitee's earnings. This rewards recruiters without penalizing new players, but introduces more currency into the server.

### Retention
Automated system to manage inactive associations.
- `upline-activity-required`: Enforces active participation. If an upline player has not logged in within the threshold, they forfeit commissions until they return.
