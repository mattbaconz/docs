## Tiered Revenue Structure
The core mechanic of Pyramid is the **Tiered Revenue System**. This encourages players to not only recruit new players but also help them succeed.

### Commission Model
When a player in a downline earns money (from any Vault-compatible source), a percentage is processed as a commission.

-   **Tier 1 (Direct)**: The immediate recruiter receives a configurable percentage (Default: **5%**) of the income.
-   **Tier 2 (Indirect)**: The recruiter's recruiter receives a configurable percentage (Default: **1%**), incentivizing long-term organizational depth.

*Note: This can be configured as a **Tax** (deducted from the earner) or **Printer** (generated by the server) in the configuration.*

## Corporate Dashboard (`/pyramid gui`)
Players can manage their organization through a comprehensive GUI.
-   **Performance Metrics**: View total revenue generated and current commission rates.
-   **Organization View**: A paginated list of all recruited players (Downline).
-   **Upline Info**: Information about the player's current referrer.

## Activity & Retention
Pyramid includes an automated system to ensure the economy remains active and competitive.

### Inactivity Cleanup
To prevent dormant accounts from cluttering the system:
-   **Recruit Inactivity**: If a recruit is offline for a configurable amount of days, they are removed from the downline, freeing them up to be recruited by active players.
-   **Upline Requirements**: Recruiters must maintain recent login activity to receive commissions. If they are inactive, commissions are suspended until they return.

## Fraud Prevention
Integrated security measures prevent abuse of the system:
-   **IP Validation**: Prevents players from recruiting alt accounts on the same IP address.
-   **Loop Detection**: Prevents circular invite chains that could cause economic instability.
-   **Cooldowns**: Prevents spamming of invite commands.

## Stonkz Integration
Pyramid integrates optionally with **Stonkz**, a stock market plugin, to add strategic depth.

### Shareholder Bonuses
Recruiters who own shares in their recruits via Stonkz receive a **Active Shareholder Bonus**, increasing their commission percentage significantly. This aligns the incentives of the recruiter with the long-term success of the recruit.

### Hostile Acquisition
Players who acquire a majority stake (>51%) in another player's stock can execute a specific command to move that player into their downline, adding a layer of competitive corporate warfare to the server.
