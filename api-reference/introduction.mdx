SeasonManager provides a Maven dependency for developers to hook into season events and access data.

## Maven Dependency

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.mattbaconz</groupId>
    <artifactId>seasonmanager-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.26</version> <!-- Check latest release -->
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Accessing the API

Get the instance of the API:

```java
import me.mattbaconz.seasonmanager.api.SeasonManagerAPI;

SeasonManagerAPI api = SeasonManagerAPI.getInstance();
```

## Listening to Events

SeasonManager fires Bukkit events that you can listen to.

### SeasonChangeStateEvent

Fired when the season transitions (e.g., PRE_SEASON -> ACTIVE).

```java
@EventHandler
public void onSeasonChange(SeasonChangeStateEvent event) {
    if (event.getNewState() == SeasonState.ACTIVE) {
        getLogger().info("The season has started!");
    }
}
```

### PlayerStashEvent

Fired when a player uses the stash.

```java
@EventHandler
public void onStashOpen(PlayerStashOpenEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    // Custom logic
}
```

## Common Methods

*   `api.getSeasonNumber()`: Returns the current season version.
*   `api.getTimeRemaining()`: Returns duration until season end.
*   `api.isInGracePeriod()`: Checks if grace period is active.
