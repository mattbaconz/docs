SeasonManager provides a comprehensive API to interact with seasons, events, the stash, and leaderboards.

## Maven Dependency

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.mattbaconz</groupId>
    <artifactId>seasonmanager-common</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.26</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Accessing Services

You can access the core services through the main plugin class `SeasonManagerBootstrap`.

```java
import me.mattbaconz.seasonmanager.SeasonManagerBootstrap;

SeasonManagerBootstrap plugin = SeasonManagerBootstrap.getInstance();
```

### 1. Cycle Manager (Seasons)
Manage the state of the current season.

```java
SeasonCycleManager cycleManager = plugin.getCycleManager();

// Get current state
SeasonState state = cycleManager.getState(); // PRE_SEASON, ACTIVE, ENDED

// Get time remaining
long millisRemaining = cycleManager.getTimeRemaining();
```

### 2. Stash Service (Cross-Season Persistence)
Interact with the player stash system.

```java
IStashService stashService = plugin.getStashService();

// Open stash for a player
stashService.openStash(player);

// Save player data asynchronously
stashService.saveStash(player).thenRun(() -> {
    getLogger().info("Stash saved!");
});
```

### 3. Leaderboard Manager
Create and manage holographic leaderboards programmatically.

```java
ILeaderboardManager leaderboardManager = plugin.getLeaderboardManager();

if (leaderboardManager.isAvailable()) {
    leaderboardManager.createLeaderboard(
        "custom_top_kills",
        location,
        StatType.KILLS,
        10
    );
}
```

## Events

SeasonManager fires standard Bukkit events.

| Event Class | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `SeasonChangeStateEvent` | Fired when the season transitions (e.g., from Grace Period to Active). |
| `PlayerStashOpenEvent` | Fired when a player opens their stash. |
| `SeasonEventTriggerEvent` | Fired when a scheduled event (from `events.yml`) executes. |

### Example Listener

```java
@EventHandler
public void onSeasonChange(SeasonChangeStateEvent event) {
    if (event.getNewState() == SeasonState.ACTIVE) {
        Bukkit.broadcastMessage("The season has officially begun!");
    }
}
```
