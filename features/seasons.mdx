## The Season Cycle

SeasonManager revolves around the concept of a "Season". A season is a defined period of gameplay that ends with a world reset (or archive) and a fresh start.

### Phases of a Season

1.  **Start / Grace Period**:
    *   The season begins.
    *   Usually accompanied by a "Grace Period" where PvP is disabled to allow players to gather resources safely.
2.  **Active Season**:
    *   The main gameplay phase.
    *   Events can trigger throughout this phase (see [Events](/features/events)).
3.  **End of Season**:
    *   Warnings are broadcast as the timer ticks down.
    *   Players scramble to stash their items.
4.  **Post-Season / Archive**:
    *   The world is saved and zipped (Prime feature).
    *   The server prepares for the next season (incrementing the version number).

## Configuration

You can customize the duration and grace period in `config.yml`:

```yaml
season:
  duration: 30d      # 30 Days
  grace-period: 1h   # 1 Hour
```

## Manual Control

Admins can manually intervene in the cycle using commands:

*   `/season start`: Starts the timer.
*   `/season stop`: Pauses the timer.
*   `/season settime <time>`: Adjusts the remaining time.
*   `/season next`: Forces the season to end immediately and proceed to the next one.
