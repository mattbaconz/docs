SeasonManager includes a built-in holographic leaderboard system (requires DecentHolograms) to track player statistics during the season.

## Supported Stats

*   **Kills**: Player kills.
*   **Deaths**: Times died.
*   **KDR**: Kill/Death Ratio.
*   **Blocks Mined**: Total blocks broken.
*   **Blocks Placed**: Total blocks placed.
*   **Mob Kills**: Hostile/passive mobs killed.
*   **Playtime**: Time spent on the server.

## Creating a Leaderboard

Admins can create a leaderboard at their current location:

` /leaderboard create <stat_type>`

**Example:**
`/leaderboard create KILLS`

## Managing Leaderboards

*   **Remove**: Stand near a leaderboard and run `/leaderboard remove`.
*   **List**: See all active leaderboards with `/leaderboard list`.
*   **Update**: Force a refresh with `/leaderboard update`.

## Configuration

Leaderboard data is updated periodically based on the `web.refresh-interval` setting in `config.yml` (if using Prime) or on server events.
