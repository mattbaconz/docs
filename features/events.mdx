The Event System is one of the most powerful features of SeasonManager. It allows you to script actions that happen at specific times relative to the start of the season.

## How it Works

Events are defined in `events.yml` using a time key and a list of actions.

Key Format: `DD:HH:MM:SS` (Days:Hours:Minutes:Seconds)

### Example Timeline

1.  **Season Start (00:00:00:05)**:
    *   Title: "Season has begun!"
    *   Sound: Level Up
2.  **Grace Period End (00:01:00:00)**:
    *   Broadcast: "PvP is now enabled!"
    *   Console Command: `worldborder set 5000`
3.  **Mid-Season (15:00:00:00)**:
    *   Broadcast: "Halfway there!"
