The Season Stash (or Vault) allows players to store a limited number of items that will persist across world resets. This is crucial for keeping players engaged, as they don't lose *everything* when a new season begins.

## How to Use

Players can open their stash using:
*   `/stash`
*   `/vault`

This opens a GUI where they can deposit items.

## Configuration

You can configure the stash in `stash.yml`.

### Size
Change the size of the GUI (rows of 9).
```yaml
stash-size: 27
```

### Restrictions
You can prevent certain OP items from being carried over.

**Blacklist Mode**: Blocks specific items.
```yaml
restriction-mode: "blacklist"
blacklisted-items:
  - DRAGON_EGG
  - BEACON
  - NETHER_STAR
```

**Whitelist Mode**: Only allows specific items.
```yaml
restriction-mode: "whitelist"
whitelisted-items:
  - DIAMOND
  - EMERALD
```

## Permissions

*   `seasonmanager.stash`: Required to open the stash.
*   `seasonmanager.stash.size.X`: Overrides the default size for VIP ranks (e.g., `seasonmanager.stash.size.54`).
