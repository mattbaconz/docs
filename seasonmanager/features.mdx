## Feature Details

### Season Timer (Lite & Prime)
The core of the plugin. Define a duration in the config, and the plugin will count down. Once the timer hits zero, the season ends automatically (if configured).

### World Management (Prime)
Prime automates the tedious process of resetting for a new season.
*   **Archiving**: The plugin automatically zips your worlds and moves them to an `archive` folder.
*   **Reset**: Generates fresh worlds for the new season.

### Cross-Season Vault (Prime)
Allow your players to keep a few precious items between seasons. Players can store items in their `/vault` before the season ends and retrieve them in the next season.

### Discord Integration (Prime)
Keep your community engaged even when they are offline. SeasonManager can send beautiful embeds to your Discord server when a season starts, ends, or when warnings are broadcast.
