**SeasonManager** is not just a timer. It is a complete, industrial-grade lifecycle engine designed for the next generation of Minecraft servers. Whether you run a competitive **SMP**, a **Lifesteal** network, or rotating **Minigames**, flawless scheduling is no longer optional—it's a requirement.

## Key Features

- **⏳ Autonomous Scheduling**: Define your timeline once. The plugin manages phases, countdowns, and world states automatically.
- **🛡️ Intelligent Grace Periods**: Protect your fresh wipe. PvP and damage settings are handled dynamically based on your season configuration.
- **📢 Event Orchestration**: From Title Announcements to BossBar countdowns, every major server event is broadcasted with style.
