## Prerequisites

Before installing SeasonManager, ensure your server meets the following requirements:

*   **Java**: Java 17 or higher
*   **Server Software**: Spigot, Paper, Purpur, or Folia (1.20+)
*   **Dependencies**:
    *   [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) (Required for placeholders)
    *   [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) (Optional, for economy integration)
    *   [DecentHolograms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decentholograms-1-8-1-20-4-papi-support-no-dependencies.96927/) (Required for leaderboards)

## Installation Steps

1.  **Download the Plugin**:
    *   **Core**: Download from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/seasonmanager).
    *   **Prime**: Download from your purchase email or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/seasonmanager) verification channel.

2.  **Upload to Server**:
    *   Stop your server completely.
    *   Upload the `SeasonManager-x.x.x.jar` file to your server's `plugins` folder.

3.  **Start the Server**:
    *   Start your server.
    *   The plugin will generate a `SeasonManager` folder in your `plugins` directory containing the default configuration files.

## First-Time Setup

After installation, we recommend checking the `config.yml` to set up your season parameters.

1.  **Open `plugins/SeasonManager/config.yml`**.
2.  **Adjust the `season.duration`**: Set how long you want your seasons to last (default is 30d).
3.  **Configure `season.grace-period`**: Set the initial safe period where PvP or damage might be disabled.
4.  **Restart or Reload**: Run `/season reload` to apply changes, or restart the server.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using MySQL, configure the database settings in `config.yml` under `statistics.storage-type`.

## Updating

To update SeasonManager:
1.  Download the new JAR file.
2.  Stop your server.
3.  Replace the old JAR with the new one.
4.  Start your server. The plugin typically handles config updates automatically, but check the changelogs for any breaking changes.
